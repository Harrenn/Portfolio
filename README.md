The dataset "Video Games Playing Reason: Exploring Motivations and Patterns" by MD. ISMIEL HOSSEN ABIR was analyzed using SQL to understand the demographics and gaming motivations of players. Key steps included cleaning the data for consistency, analyzing demographic factors like age and gender, and examining gaming habits and motivations. The exploration provided insights into common reasons for playing, such as entertainment and competition, and identified favorite and most played games among different groups. This highlights skills in data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and summarizing key findings.

## <a href="https://github.com/Harrenn/Portfolio/blob/main/Interactive%20KPI%20Dashboard%20for%20Business%20Performance%20Monitoring.xlsx">Interactive KPI Excel Dashboard for Business Performance Monitoring
 
This interactive KPI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators critical to our business operations. The dashboard tracks and displays progress across multiple metrics, including total revenue, number of Google reviews, new payroll clients, new investment assets, new business services clients, and audit protection taken (both 1040 and business audits).

The top section features a progress bar that visually represents the completion percentage for each KPI, facilitating quick assessment of performance against set goals. The line charts on the right side offer month-by-month trends for Google reviews, payroll clients, and business service clients, highlighting fluctuations and patterns over time.

This dashboard is designed for intuitive use, allowing stakeholders to interact with the data for deeper insights and better decision-making. For example, clicking on different metrics or months can filter and display detailed information relevant to the selected category. This functionality makes it easier to identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement, ensuring that we stay on track to meet our annual objectives.
