## Data Explorations

<a href="https://github.com/Harrenn/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Exploration%20of%20Video%20Game%20Playing%20Reason%20Dataset.ipynb"><b>Data Exploration of Video Game Playing Reason Dataset</b></a>

The dataset "Video Games Playing Reason: Exploring Motivations and Patterns" by MD. ISMIEL HOSSEN ABIR was analyzed using SQL to understand the demographics and gaming motivations of players. Key steps included cleaning the data for consistency, analyzing demographic factors like age and gender, and examining gaming habits and motivations. The exploration provided insights into common reasons for playing, such as entertainment and competition, and identified favorite and most played games among different groups. This highlights skills in data cleaning, descriptive analysis, and summarizing key findings.
